Queuing scripts for recursive automatic submission

In some systems it may not be allowed to requeue (e.g. TACC)

Copy the bin directory into your home directory,
along with the two templates corresponding to the system, 
and link CONFIG.default to the template file.

Requirements: grep, head, ls, sed, sort, awk.
You may have to change some grep commands to the one in
your system accepting extended regular expressions.

JSC example of iterative job submission:

llrun -np 64 -exe ./iniflow.x -mode SMP -env "OMP_NUM_THREADS=4"

For the nonblocking communication mode in JSC you need to add

export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/rubik/rubik-1.0.1/.

to the file .profile
